//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// About
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This mod drastically increases the difficulty of MM8 combat, making it a requirement to obtain the best equipment and invest into strongest skills in order to successfully complete the game.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Installation
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You will need:
 - a copy of Might & Magic VIII (https://www.gog.com/game/might_and_magic_8_day_of_the_destroyer)
 - GrayFace MM8 Patch (https://grayface.github.io/mm/#GrayFace-MM8-Patch)

1) Install the game and the patch
2) Create DataFiles folder in the game directory
3) Copy files from the mod's folders into DataFiles


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Contents
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For convenience of those who don't like everything dumped together, the mod's content is split into three separate folders.

 - Monsters -
On average, monster HP and damage is tripled.
Many of the monsters are given new abilities to make them more distinct from each other.
A, B and C monster varieties that inhabit multiple locations suited for different party levels also have greater difference in stats. Low-level locations will mostly spawn A types, with occasional B and C types acting as leaders and bosses, while areas designed for higher levels will spawn greater numbers mostly consisting of B and C types.

 - Items -
Changes include:
L5 and especially L6 items are more likely to come with top enchantments, and to be dropped by dragons and other monsters capable of L6 loot.
Moderately increased damage for axes, to make Minotaur class a bit more useful.
Potions of Divine Cure/Power require one less yellow reagent and one more red/blue respectively.
...and a few other minor tweaks I can't quite remember.

 - Talimere -
This will replace Frederic Talimere (joinable male cleric NPC) with Celeste Talimere (female).
The game didn't have any female clerics unless you play as one, so here we go.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Details and walkthrough tips
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

These are not complete and only focus on particularly notable abilities the monsters possess.

 - Dagger Wound Island -
Pirates can be dealt with in small groups, but avoiding the reinforcement spawn points is a good idea.
The coatles in Abandoned Temple, while somewhat less of a breezewalk, are nonetheless not a real threat. Serpentmen, on the other hand, make for a boss encounter at the exit, and pretty much prevent you from collecting the idol without training several levels beforehand.

 - Ravenshore -
Clearing Smuggler's Cove is doable with a couple extra levels and Hour of Power blessing from the temple. Watch out for occasional type B blue enemies and possible type C red ones, especially mages - their attacks cause sleep and multiple shots of Posion Spray can hit several party members at once. Wererats can steal items from inventory, so kill them quick before they close in.
Centaurs now may drop diamonds that can be traded for horseshoes in Murmurwoods, but their attacks will quickly wipe out a low-level party.

 - Alvar -
Wasps come in greater numbers than before, and can quickly poison/paralyze/kill their way through Protection from Magic, so they're best left alone until mid-game.

 - Ironsand Desert -
Like their HoMM4 cousins, cyclops can now throw boulders in the form of Rock Blast spell. Have fun :)

 - Garrot Gorge -
All the dragons can now use Dragon Breath spell, making cyclops pale in comparison.
Crusaders shouldn't be taken lightly either because of high AC and physical resistance.
Remember that Dragon Cave contains several artifacts and updates every six months, and that each artifact can only spawn once, so don't enter unless you're confident you can return with Invisibility soon.

 - Shadowspire -
Vampires can cause unconsciousness (HP instantly dropped to 0), while necromancers drain mana instead.
Bone dragons can be problematic due to Pain Reflection and somewhat higher HP than other monsters in the area.

 - Murmurwoods -
Wisps can shoot Sunray, which hits for high irresistible damage and is much faster than majority of other projectiles. Stay on the road and run without stopping until you get into safety of the town.
Basilisks can now use range attacks, so using the flight while looking for Cauri no longer provides safety from getting stoned.
Unicorns will use Dispel Magic and inflict sleep condition, making them particularly bothersome to deal with early. However, they also drop diamonds now, so try clearing them in the first year for extra skillpoints.
Priests of the Sun in the temple can summon Wisps and dispel.

 - Ravage Roaming -
Tritons in Balthazar Lair have decent AC and can use Ice Blast, but are doable after level 20. Watch out for crusaders (type C, red) though, these can seriously dent such party.
Efretti in Crypt of Corbu have "fire shield" which translates into very massive fireball upon death, potentially dealing hundreds of fire damage.

 - Regna -
Pirate mages can heal, summon elementals (not the greater variety though) and inflict sleep.

 - Elemental Planes -
All elementals inflict hundreds of elemental (i.e. resistable) damage and can summon lesser versions of themselves. Greater ones are especially dangerous because their minions can in turn spawn even more reinforcements, and killing a greater elemental is an arduous task because of nearly 3k HP they have.
Air - huge AC and Sparks (close range AoE damage).
Fire - fast recovery speed.
Water - can heal themselves.
Earth - physical resistance and Rock Blast. Recovery speed is slower, but melee attacks do twice the damage which may go over a thousand, so even a Power Cure potion may not be enough to return a party member back in line from such negatives.

Other monsters found in elemental planes:
Phoenixes can heal themselves.
Dragon Turtles and Juggernauts have great AC and physical resistance. The former's attacks can also swallow, or, technically, eradicate.
Ravenmen can steal.
Thunderbirds can knock out.

 - Endgame -
Crystal walkers explode for hundreds of physical damage when killed.
Ether Knights combine the worst of unicorns and necromancers, with access to Dispel Magic, Pain Reflection and mana drain upon hit.
Nightmares can knock out and heal themselves, on top of high resistances and light/dark/physical immunities.
Behemoths can breed infinitely. That is, unlike elementals who can only summon lesser minions, these spawn exact copies of themselves. With over 1.5k HP for greater behemoths, it is possible for their population to grow completely out of control (unless there're two necromancers in party).
Crystal dragons just have thousands of HP.




Notes on party composition:
Cleric is a must, without Power Cure some areas are next to impossible to survive.
Necromancer can theoretically be skipped, but some monsters require lots damage dealt to them very quickly.
Either dragon or troll is required to carry the party back into safety after sustaining obscene amounts of damage from magic attacks.
